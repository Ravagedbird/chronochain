# Cronochain: Galactic timestamps that survive us.
# Cronochain – Time that survives civilization

**One-sentence pitch**  
A 256-bit hash made from the exact rotation phases of eight millisecond pulsars at a given moment.  
No servers. No humans. No trust.  
Just physics.

**Why it exists**  
GPS dies. NTP dies. Atomic clocks stop.  
Pulsars keep spinning for billions of years with nanosecond stability.  
If you can see the sky, you can verify a Cronochain proof — today, in 1,000 years, or after the next ice age.

**What you get**  
- A timestamp that cannot be back-dated (you’d have to fake the light from stars)  
- >300 bits of real physical entropy  
- Verifiable forever with a $500 radio telescope  
- Works on Earth, Mars, or a spaceship 40 AU out — same eight stars, same truth

**Current status**  
v0.9 spec – prototype in <100 lines Python – looking for astronomers, crypto builders, and people who hate fragile time.

Because when everything else is dust, the pulsars will still be ticking.
## Next Orbit

- **Prototype It:** Fork, run the stub on a dummy doc (this README?), verify against Tempo2 ephemeris. Commit your first hash—let's chain 'em.
- **Collaborate:** Astronomers, hit me with pulsar picks. Crypto heads, EdDSA tweaks? Devs, GPS embed script? Issues/PRs open—no gatekeeping.
- **Amplify:** Share on X: "Timestamped this with neutron stars. Cronochain: because Earth time is fragile. #PulsarProof #CosmicChain" + repo link.
- **Weave Wider:** Pair with Loom for pulsar-secured routing. Time + space = unbreakable web. Repo: [loom-dns](https://github.com/Ravagedbird/loom-dns).

Pulsars spun before us. They'll spin after. This is our tick. What's your first proof?
