# Cronochain: Galactic timestamps that survive us.
# Cronochain – Time that survives civilization

**One-sentence pitch**  
A 256-bit hash made from the exact rotation phases of eight millisecond pulsars at a given moment.  
No servers. No humans. No trust.  
Just physics.

**Why it exists**  
GPS dies. NTP dies. Atomic clocks stop.  
Pulsars keep spinning for billions of years with nanosecond stability.  
If you can see the sky, you can verify a Cronochain proof — today, in 1,000 years, or after the next ice age.

**What you get**  
- A timestamp that cannot be back-dated (you’d have to fake the light from stars)  
- >300 bits of real physical entropy  
- Verifiable forever with a $500 radio telescope  
- Works on Earth, Mars, or a spaceship 40 AU out — same eight stars, same truth

**Current status**  
v0.9 spec – prototype in <100 lines Python – looking for astronomers, crypto builders, and people who hate fragile time.

Because when everything else is dust, the pulsars will still be ticking.
